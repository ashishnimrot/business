## Go/No-Go Decision

### Ready for MVP Development: ✅ YES

**Rationale:**
- All critical planning documents complete
- Technical architecture well-defined
- Team structure and budget documented
- Risk mitigation plans in place
- Clear MVP scope with 16-sprint timeline

### Remaining Dependencies (Non-Blocking)

1. **Budget Approval** - Needs management sign-off
2. **Legal Review** - Templates need lawyer review
3. **Third-Party Accounts** - Can be set up in Week 0-1
4. **Team Hiring** - Can proceed in parallel with Sprint 1

---

## Recommendation

**Start MVP Development** with the following parallel tracks:

1. **Week 0:** 
   - Get budget approval
   - Set up AWS and GitHub
   - Begin team hiring

2. **Sprint 1:**
   - Start development (Auth Service)
   - Complete CI/CD setup
   - Third-party account setup

3. **Ongoing:**
   - Legal review in background
   - Design work ahead of development
   - Continuous documentation updates
